## HOW TO CHANGE NAME

change name.settings file to name.txt then u can edit the name to whatever then change it back to .settings



## Note
I recommend not using all of the animations you can either look threw and remove the ones you want and make a new manifest with https://github.com/Wuhpondiscord/FlipperZero-EZ-Manifest or you can edit the manifest
